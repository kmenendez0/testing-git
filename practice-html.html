<h1>Practice File: A Newbie's Attempt At Learning How to Use Atom
</h1>

<h2>Summary:</h2>

<p>I'm typing this up in <a href="https://atom.io/"><em><strong><u>Atom</u></strong></em>.</a> I'm completely new to text editors, markup languages, and programming in general.
This really does feel complex even though it's just the basics. Baby steps but making progress so I guess that's
a good thing.</p>

<p id="styled-p">Here's a basic CSS element.</p>
<p id="styled-p2">Good stuff.</p>

<h2 class="headings">Heading 2: Electric Boogaloo</h2>
  <p>Using a bunch of basic tier tags because it's all I know so far.</p>

  <h3 class="headings">Majestic</h3>
  <h4 class="headings">Not really though.</h4>
